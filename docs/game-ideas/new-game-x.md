New Game X (name pending)
=========================
What you're reading now is the (very unfinished/barely started) thoughts I have for a new game I want to build with my own engine. I'll probably use this file that you're reading now as a notepad of sorts to keep track of the ideas I have for e.g. enemies, story, game mechanics, etc.

This description is very rough of course - but a place to collect thoughts and ideas.

Story
-----
Keeping it simple: Earth is invaded by some unknown force. It's 2103, a couple of years since the Coronavirus pandemic was declared to be over. Mankind no longer has a military force (It's hard to wage wars with social distancing), so it's up to you to save them all. You've stayed away from civilization for years, deep in the jungle. It's time to show the world you're alive.

Gameplay elements
--------
* Side-scrolling platformer/shooter - the character is of the walking/running kind.
* Procedurally generated maps(?)
* Can shoot horizontally and at angles up to a certain point (e.g. in a 30 degree arc or so). I want to not have the "main weapon" be able to shoot vertically to open up niches for other weapon types.
* Swarms of enemies (at least later parts!)
* It would be really cool to have some sort of resource collection and upgrade system. E.g. collecting scrap metal from enemies and building better armor/weapons from this.
* A simple experience/leveling system could be cool.

Progression
------
Not sure if there should be a "world map" and have the ability to replay different areas to grow stronger if stuck on a more difficult area? Perhaps!

Possible biomes in order of difficulty:
* Forest/jungle
* Desert
* Suburbs/City
* Alien mothership? Perhaps after a certain amount of progression you will find teleports to take you up there.

Enemy types
----
More to come here - but some things I want to have:
* Ground enemies (creatures, vehicles)
* Air-based enemies that may require different weaponry to take care of
* Some kind off "spawner" thing that you need to destroy
